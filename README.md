# Coingate Sandbox Payment App
**How to install:** 
1. Clone current repository **git clone https://github.com/glitzybunny/coingate_sandbox_payment.git**
2. **pip install -r requirements.txt**
3. It works now! Check it out on **localhost:8000**

**Feedback. Implementation is not through Coingate callbacks(it would be the best decision to track Order status). They don't work in localhost env.  Check out the link below**
